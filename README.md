## Usage

To use this application, the user will visit the page and be presented a daily planner.

A user will be able to click into the open text field within an hourly block to add text - a reminder, a task etc - upon clicking save, the data will stay put in the application. They can of course delete and hit save again, or type over the existing data to edit it, or they an click the button up top to "clear all data" and start over fresh.
